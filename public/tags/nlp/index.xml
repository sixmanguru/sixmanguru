&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the MLB Playoffs beginning this evening, I figured it was time to test my rankings and pull out the old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/generic-sports-series-probability-calculator/&#34;&gt;probability calculator&lt;/a&gt;. I created the MLB Ratings based on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;simple least squares NLP Optimization&lt;/a&gt; that I have discussed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oakland at Kansas City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royals are in the playoffs for the first time in ages and they get to host a game. Unfortunately, they didn’t seem to have a home field advantage during the regular season, so I am not sure how much this helps (although in reality we can assume it does, at least a little). The numbers say the A’s are the better team by almost 0.7 of a run (per game, for the season). I show them as a 63.5% favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first weekend of the NCAA Tournament was a wild one. In our competition, we chose models with high variance, knowing full well we could be in a world of hurt if a game or two did not go our way. Being scored on a log loss scale was new to us, and we knew of the risks, but did not really think things could get too bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Super Bowl Least Squares Predictions — take the points</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/super-bowl-least-squares-predictions-take-the-points/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been applying Least Squares Optimization principals to the NFL in making predictions. The method is fairly well established, simply to do and so far — very effective. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;here’s a link to the first article explaining it all&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up-To-Date Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In games where the (expected line-actual line)/actual &amp;gt;100%, the line went 15-5 -1 since I started this in week 13 and 2-2 during the playoffs&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Least Squares Predictions 3-0-1 During NFL Wild Card Round</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/least-squares-predictions-3-0-1-during-nfl-wild-card-round/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the first weekend of the NFL Playoffs completed, it seemed like a good time to catch up on how well the Least Squares Optimization predictions did the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time reading about this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;please refer to my initial article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s recap the final week of the regular season. Using only the games where the percentage difference between the expected line and the actual lines (from by sportsbook.com when published) was greater than 100%, the predictor went 3-1. In games where the raw absolute value of the expected and actual lines was greater than 2.5, the predictor went 5-3. Overall the predictor went 12-3 (the Bears-Packers game did not have a line sure to the unsure status of Aaron Rodgers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 17 NFL Lines and Least Squares Predictions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/week-17-nfl-lines-and-least-squares-predictions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have not read any of my previous Least Squared posting, please refer to the initial post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 16 in review:&lt;/strong&gt; Only one game was in the range where we have been fairly confident on the selections. New England was a favorite in the system, but getting 2.5 points from Vegas. New England destroyed the Ravens, so the &amp;gt;100% difference between the expected and Vegas lines, bring that rule to 12-3 over the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>College Bowl Season Predictions Based on Least Squared Non-Linear Programming Model</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/college-bowl-season-predictions-based-on-least-squared-non-linear-programming-model/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of data out there when it comes to college football, so I decided to take the time to create a least squares model, based on the same principals I have been using for the NFL, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;outlined here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to take all 752 schools that played college football, cross that with all 4138 games that were played (up to last weekend) and see how they predict the games (especially versus the Vegas lines).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NFL Week 15 Lines, Week 14 update and Least Squares NLP</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/nfl-week-15-lines-week-14-update-and-least-squares-nlp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick update on last week’s post where I use Non-Linear Programming methods to predict the NFL lines. Let’s rehash. You can also read the explanation post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;, where I dive into Non-Linear Programming and the methods involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Week 13&lt;/strong&gt; games, the least squares approach went 10-5 overall, 3-1 where the percentage of expected vs. Vegas line was greater than 100% and 6-4 when the absolute raw difference was greater than 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We finished classes yesterday, so all that is left for the semester is a homework assignment, three projects and three more exams. I have whittled this away to only needing to complete one last project and study for the exams. But, instead of finishing my database project, which is due Sunday, I elected to take a deeper dive into a classroom example for an exam I had yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
