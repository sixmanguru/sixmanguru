      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 100,000 simulations, the Throckmorton Greyhounds appear to have a 29.8% chance to win the UIL D2 Six-Man State Championship. The biggest challenge it appears will be the dominance of the East bracket, which won a dominating 80.1% of the time in the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about how the Crowell Wildcats are a somewhat dominant 33.1% to repeat as the D1 UIL State Six-Man Champions. If you would like to read more details on the methods, I have several posted below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just did a quick run of 100,000 playoff simulations and wanted to share the quick results. I will try to get some finer detail or maybe look into a few changes, but here are the raw World Series champion results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detroit — 4950&lt;br/&gt;
Baltimore — 18592&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LA Angels — 31876&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Kansas City — 9058&lt;br/&gt;
Washington — 19768&lt;br/&gt;
San Francisco — 4246&lt;br/&gt;
St. Louis — 1662&lt;br/&gt;
LA Dodgers — 9848&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the MLB Playoffs beginning this evening, I figured it was time to test my rankings and pull out the old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/generic-sports-series-probability-calculator/&#34;&gt;probability calculator&lt;/a&gt;. I created the MLB Ratings based on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/&#34;&gt;simple least squares NLP Optimization&lt;/a&gt; that I have discussed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oakland at Kansas City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royals are in the playoffs for the first time in ages and they get to host a game. Unfortunately, they didn’t seem to have a home field advantage during the regular season, so I am not sure how much this helps (although in reality we can assume it does, at least a little). The numbers say the A’s are the better team by almost 0.7 of a run (per game, for the season). I show them as a 63.5% favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the baseball playoffs upon us, I have decided to start building a simulator to determine series outcomes once they start. I decided to make this as generic as possible. This simulator is not specific to baseball or even to a particular series length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the first parts to think about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sixmanguru.com/mlb-home-field-advantage-this-season/&#34;&gt;I addressed in my previous post relating to home field advantage&lt;/a&gt;, ratings and the probability a team would win a single game versus a specific opponent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
