    <p>Saturday marks the running of the 2021 NCAA D1 Cross Country National Championships in Tallahassee with Northern Arizona on the brink of their fifth team title in six years.
It has been a while since I have publically published any new models in any sport, but yesterday on Twitter, Citius Magazine posted something about a video they had done with Isaac Wood at The Wood Report on his prediction.
Being relatively new to the world of collegiate track and cross country, I had no idea who Isaac was and immediately went and subscribed to his website to see what he had built. I also like to see how others model sport and Isaac has an interesting website.

    <p>The End
This is going to be a long and rambling story. Some of it may be new to many of you, but I just wanted to get it down on paper as I decide to close a chapter in my life.
When I started ranking six-man football teams during the 1993 season, I never imagined that 28 seasons later I would still be doing it.
I did not come from a six-man town. Heck, the high school I went to was always in the largest UIL classification, save for my senior year.

    <p>Ed note — the full article (with rankings) is posted here, http://texascollegetennis.com/2016/12/13/a-new-approach-to-ranking-singles-players-in-the-fall/. I will get more technical below.
I decided awhile back that the way players are ranked in the fall by the ITA is a bit arbitrary. I am not trying to be critical of the ITA, because trying to rank singles players across the country before they’ve played a single match is not only extremely difficult, not only from a pure mechanical standpoint, but also politically.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was fooling around with some ideas about the season and decided I would put out some rankings for the fall half of the season. Sure I could write something or maybe use UTR, but what do college tennis players like even more than tennis? That’s right, video games. So i honor of this, I decided to use Microsoft’s Trueskill algorithm to rank how the fall season went (based on what has been entered into the ITA database as of this morning–11/11)…

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>We’ve all played that game I beat so-and-so, who beat so-and-so, so by the transitive property, I also beat that player.
Yesterday I wrote about the path from Australian Chris Fletcher’s indirect win over the world’s top-ranked player, Novak Djokovic. I was knee-deep into the research on that when I discovered it counted walkovers.
I rewrote a little code and today I top that. No walkovers, longer paths.
Our journey this time starts in Uzbekistan where 18 year old Saida’lo Saidkarimov defeats Sarvar Ikramov in the second round of the Tashkent Challenger. Saidkarimov is a wild card and only garners one main draw victory this year (at Uzbekistan F4) and sits appropriately ranked 2150.

    <p>Remember that time in 2015 when the world’s top-ranked player, Novak Djokovic lost to unranked Australian Chris Letcher? You don’t. Well it could’ve happened.
In doing some research on the 2015 season, I decided to jump down the wormhole of who would have the worst possible indirect win over Djokovic. These types of path or graph theory problems are fun to explore. What is the simplest, longest past over a certain player? And along the way, can we find the ‘worst’ or lowest-ranked player…

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>People have always compared six-man football to a computer game. With its wild scores and fast-paced style, six-man football can be just as exciting, if not more so.
So what if you played the entire six-man season on your Xbox?
That’s why I decided to use the TrueSkill Ranking System created by Microsoft Research for Xbox Live games and apply it to the season.
Microsoft uses this algorithm to track the skill of gamers in order to place them in competitive matches. On the Microsoft Research website it explains that the ranking system is characterized by two attributes: a players average skill level (ranking) and the degree of uncertainty in the gamer’s skill (this would be the variation in the players level). If you would like to read more, it can be found at the Microsoft Research website, http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/
