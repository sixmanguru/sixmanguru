This year the UIL was prepared and had a back-up plan to divert traffic off their site.
So at exactly 9:00 am, the Twitterverse was alive with the ramblings of everyone who cares about Texas high school football.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>About two weeks ago I published an article on Texas fan sentiment analysis, based on over 50,000 tweets I collected the day of the Valero Alamo Bowl.
This was fairly straightforward, as I utilized the code my colleague Taylor Smith created and modified it for my purposes. My biggest changes came with how I analyzed the data.
The problem I had was that the process of obtaining the tweets tied up my R console. This was problematic because I could neither use R, nor start looking at the data. Another problem was I had to determine up front how long I wanted to run the search. I could kill the process, but if the game ran past the time I had set, I would have to rush and restart it again.

    <p>With the first weekend of the NFL Playoffs completed, it seemed like a good time to catch up on how well the Least Squares Optimization predictions did the past two weeks.
If this is your first time reading about this, please refer to my initial article here.
First, let’s recap the final week of the regular season. Using only the games where the percentage difference between the expected line and the actual lines (from by sportsbook.com when published) was greater than 100%, the predictor went 3-1. In games where the raw absolute value of the expected and actual lines was greater than 2.5, the predictor went 5-3. Overall the predictor went 12-3 (the Bears-Packers game did not have a line sure to the unsure status of Aaron Rodgers.

Yes, 1-11 Purdue, with their big time win over Indiana State. It sounds absurd, doesn’t it? But like 118 other teams in the NCAA Division I BCS, they have an indirect win over Alabama (and Auburn for that matter).
This is one of the reasons I love college football.
You hear all of the talk about how on any given day, TEAM A can beat TEAM B. But we don’t believe it, until some Saturday in the fall, Georgia Southern beats Florida or Appalachian State beats Michigan.

    <p>With Monday night’s Alamo Bowl being Coach Mack Brown’s final game as coach of the Texas Longhorns, it seemed like a good opportunity to test fan sentiment on the occasion via Twitter. I captured tweets containing certain words in an attempt to follow sentiment towards Mack Brown and Texas over time, leading up to the game, during the game and afterwards for a brief period.
I began collecting data around 2:25 PM CST and stopped just after 10:00 PM. The search terms I used were: Mack Brown, mackbrown, Texas Football, Texas Longhorn, hookem and hook em. During that time period, over 51,000 tweets were collected using these search terms. Please not that these terms could be used as regular words, a part of words as well as hashtags.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Sometimes you just need to slow down and look at the data a little closer.
That was the case last week when I mistakenly posted the wrong side of the New England-Miami line. I mentioned it was probably best to stay away from it all together due to the raw difference being so small, but I also stated the wrong side to take. Oh well. Lesson learned.
Week 15 review – The least-squares method and choosing only those lines where the percentage difference of expected and actual Vegas line over the actual line was greater than 100% went a shocking 4-0. Did I bet it this way? Nope. The three lines between 80-100% went 1-2. In games where the absolute raw was greater than 2.5 went 3-2. Overall, the LS method went an incredible 11-4-1.
