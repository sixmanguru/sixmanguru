<p>For the past few months, I have been applying Least Squares Optimization principals to the NFL in making predictions. The method is fairly well established, simply to do and so far — very effective. (<a href="http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/">here’s a link to the first article explaining it all</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Up-To-Date Results</strong><br/>
In games where the (expected line-actual line)/actual &gt;100%, the line went 15-5 -1 since I started this in week 13 and 2-2 during the playoffs</p>
<p>In games where the absolute value of the (expected-actual)&gt;2.5, it has gone 25-14-1 since week 13 and 3-2 during the playoffs.</p>
<p>In all games the method has gone 53-30-2 since week 13 and 6-4 during the playoffs.</p>

<p>As you can see, the system expected Denver to be getting points and they are giving them, so all signs point to <strong>taking the Seahawks and the points</strong>.</p>
