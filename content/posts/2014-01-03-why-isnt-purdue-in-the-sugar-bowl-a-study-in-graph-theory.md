<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Why isn’t Purdue in the Sugar Bowl?</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, 1-11 Purdue, with their big time win over Indiana State. It sounds absurd, doesn’t it? But like 118 other teams in the NCAA Division I BCS, they have an indirect win over Alabama (and Auburn for that matter).</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I love college football.</p>
<p>You hear all of the talk about how on any given day, TEAM A can beat TEAM B. But we don’t believe it, until some Saturday in the fall, Georgia Southern beats Florida or Appalachian State beats Michigan.</p>
<p>This is a story, not so much that a team like Purdue has a win over the mighty SEC teams like Alabama, but the amazing journey of how we get there.</p>
<p>A little background: I have been working on a project that connects College Football and graph theory – actually graph databases. I am going to skip through this, but if you are interested at all, just go here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database or download the free book located here, http://www.neo4j.org/learn). I use the Neo4j software.</p>
<p>The central concept is to connect teams together as nodes in a huge network. The data presented here was not compiled using this exact software, but by other means, as I attempted to verify parts of the database I am building. I will write more on that at a later date.</p>
<p>Back to Purdue, a horrible team (sorry Jerry and Drew), that went 1-11 and only beat NCAA Division I FBS Indiana State. How can they have an indirect win over Alabama? With a little luck and some help from the NCAA and NAIA playoffs in other divisions is the short answer.</p>
<p>It is a long and winding trip, which starts deep in the heart of the Midwest, travels through the backwoods of collegiate football not known to the casual reader and ends at Jordan-Hare Stadium… and it takes an incredible 40 games to connect the dots. Yes, 40 games.</p>
<p>The 40 games is by far the longest path this season, by a long shot, which starts and ends at a NCAA I BCS school. The next longest paths are Kentucky, Tulsa and UTEP’s 15-game paths to Alabama.</p>
<p>That is quite a jump and it is a long journey, so let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>September 7, 2013 (Lafayette, IN)</strong><br/>
<strong> Purdue 20 Indiana State 14</strong><br/>
It began in September when the Boilermakers, full of hope and promise, took it to the Sycamores. Unfortunately, they never won again.</p>
<p><strong>September 14 (Terre Haute, IN)</strong><br/>
<strong> Indiana State 70 Quincy 7</strong><br/>
Not many realize this, but Indiana State went 1-11 as well, but their lone victory came the next weekend in a 70-7 rout of NCAA Division II, Quincy University.</p>
<p>Quincy is a small, Franciscan school of about 1300 students located on the banks of the Mississippi River in West Central Illinois. It was the college of Father Augustine Tolton, the first African-American Catholic priest.</p>
<p><strong>September 28 (Quincy, IL)</strong><br/>
<strong> Quincy 36 Lindenwood University-Belleville 7</strong><br/>
The Quincy Hawks of Quincy, Illinois did not soar this season, going a paltry 2-9.</p>

The football team is known for having the barbershop-striped field that alternates <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/19577824/naia-lindenwood-university-no-apologies-for-unusual-turf">grey and red stripes</a> every five yards.</p>

According to Wikipedia, “since 1903, when the ‘Terrible Swedes’ were feared and respected by all opponents, students and alumni have rallied Bethany athletic competition with the ‘Rockar! Stockar!’ cheer.” This apparently means “Rocks! Sticks!”.</p>

<p><strong>October 12 (Ave Maria, FL)</strong><br/>
<strong> Ave Maria 45 Florida Tech 41</strong><br/>

<strong> Morehouse 42 Central St OH 20</strong><br/>
The Central State Marauders were NCAA Division II national runner-up in 1983 and won NAIA titles in 1990, 1992 and 1995. Then, due to financial difficulties, the school dropped football in 1997, only reinstating the sport in 2005.</p>
<p>The school counts quite a few dignitaries as alum, including former President of Malawi, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Pro Bowl lineman Erik Williams, baseball player Eddie Milner and ‘actress’ Omorosa (from The Apprentice) also attended Central State.</p>
<p><strong>October 12 (Wilberforce, OH)</strong><br/>
<strong> Central St OH 25 Miles 21</strong><br/>
Located in Fairfield, Alabama, Miles is another historically black university founded in 1898. The football team was part of history this year when their game against Lane was officiated by a crew that included four women, marking the first time in history a predominantly female crew had officiated at any NCAA level.</p>
<p>The school is also the alma mater of Autherine Lucy, who graduated in 1952 then applied to graduate school at Alabama, eventually becoming the first African American student in the school’s history. She was expelled three days into school, as the university felt it could not provide a safe environment for her. The University of Alabama overturned her expulsion in 1980 and she earned a Master’s degree in 1982.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL FUN FACT</strong> – Four of those teams ONLY won two games each. Shorter, Clark Atlanta, Morehouse and Central St OH won a combined eight games.</p>
<p><strong>November 9 (Tuskegee, AL)</strong><br/>
<strong> Miles 41 Tuskegee 36</strong><br/>
Of course everyone knows that Tuskegee University is world-renowned as one of the first historically black universities, the home of the Tuskegee Airmen and was founded by George Washington Carver and Booker T Washington. But it also happens to be the shortest distance geographically to Jordan-Hare Stadium, where this journey will end. It is a mere 20.5 miles from Abbott Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>September 7 (Huntsville, AL)</strong><br/>
<strong> Tuskegee 23 Alabama A&amp;M 7</strong><br/>
With Alabama A&amp;M, we are back in the NCAA Division I FBS, where the SWAC will exchange this chain for a few games. Famous Alabama A&amp;M alumns are American Idol Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard and Pro Football Hall of Famer John Stallworth.</p>

<strong> Stephen F. Austin 52 Montana State 38</strong><br/>
Montana State earned a share of the 1956 NAIA title when they played St. Joseph’s of Indiana to a 0-0 tie in the Aluminum Bowl. They won the 1976 NCAA Division II title and the 1984 NCAA Division I-A title. They are the only team to win national titles in three different divisions.

<p><strong>October 5 (Bozeman, MT)</strong><br/>
<strong> Montana State 36 Northern Arizona 7</strong><br/>
Northern Arizona’s initial graduating class consisted of four women who received teaching credentials for the then Arizona Territory. It is a far cry from the 26,000+ who now attend.</p>
<p><strong>September 21 (Flagstaff, AZ)</strong><br/>
<strong> Northern Arizona 22 South Dakota 16</strong><br/>
Located in Vermillion, South Dakota, school was founded in 1862 as the University of Vermillion and is the oldest postsecondary institution in the Dakotas. The Yotes (formally Coyotes) now play in the Summit League.</p>

<p><strong>August 31 (Ames, IA)</strong><br/>
<strong> Northern Iowa 28 Iowa State 20</strong><br/>
After 32 games outside of Division I BCS, the trail returns.</p>
<p><strong>November 30 (Morgantown, WV)</strong><br/>
<strong> Iowa State 52 West Virginia 44</strong><br/>
These two teams were by far the strangest in the Big 12 this season. West Virginia lost to both Kansas and Iowa State, but also defeated Oklahoma State to extend our chain.</p>
<p><strong>September 28 (Morgantown, WV)</strong><br/>
<strong> West Virginia 30 Oklahoma State 21</strong><br/>
I still don’t know how this happened, other than this was OSU’s usual letdown loss.</p>
<p><strong>August 31 (Reliant Stadium, Houston, TX)</strong><br/>
<strong> Oklahoma State 21 Mississippi State 3</strong><br/>
The rest fall in the hands of the mighty SEC.</p>
<p><strong>November 28 (Starkville, MS)</strong><br/>
<strong> Mississippi St 17 Mississippi 10</strong><br/>
Jamerson Love’s fumble recovery in the end zone of what looked like it was going to be an easy Ole Miss touchdown shockingly ended the Egg Bowl.</p>
<p><strong>October 19 (Oxford, MS)</strong><br/>
<strong> Mississippi 27 LSU 24</strong><br/>
Ole Miss gets the biggest win of Hugh Freeze’s tenure.</p>
<p><strong>September 21 (Baton Rouge, LA)</strong><br/>
<strong> LSU 35 Auburn 21</strong><br/>
When LSU defeated Auburn, the Tigers were in the middle of the SEC and national title hunts. Little did we know how the fates of the two schools would reverse several months later.</p>
<p><strong>November 30 (Auburn, AL)</strong><br/>
<strong> Auburn 34 Alabama 28</strong><br/>
Finally, in the Iron Bowl, Auburn shocks Alabama on the ridiculous field goal return by Chris Davis on the final play of the game. The chain is complete.</p>
<p>So there it was: 40 games. Purdue -&gt; Alabama.</p>
