<p>Just a quick update on last week’s post where I use Non-Linear Programming methods to predict the NFL lines. Let’s rehash. You can also read the explanation post <a href="http://www.sixmanguru.com/nfl-week-14-predictions-ratings-optimization-and-non-linear-programming/">HERE</a>, where I dive into Non-Linear Programming and the methods involved.</p>
<p><strong>For Week 13</strong> games, the least squares approach went 10-5 overall, 3-1 where the percentage of expected vs. Vegas line was greater than 100% and 6-4 when the absolute raw difference was greater than 2.5.</p>
<p><strong>For week 14</strong>, it was not very good overall. It went 6-8, but went 4-2 when the percentage of expected vs. Vegas was greater than 100% and 4-2 when the absolute raw was greater than 2.5. Note: we did this experiment AFTER the Thursday night game.</p>
<p>We had a $5 parlay bet with four games and we went 3-1. Ugh. Should’ve of just bet straight up. Oh well, not as much fun.</p>
<p><strong>Totals for two weeks: </strong>16-13 overall, 7-3 when the percentage of expected vs. Vegas line was greater than 100% and 10-6 when the absolute raw is greater than 2.5.</p>
<p>So that give us a few games to really look at for <strong>WEEK 15</strong>:</p>

<p>It recommends taking Seattle (-7), Indianapolis (-6), Buffalo (-1) and New England (-1). Of course that small difference and line for the NE-MIA game is suspicious, but those are the pure suggestions.</p>
<p>How about this? A Seahawks, Bills, Colts and Bengals parlay. $5-&gt;$61.73 and maybe a Bengals, Chiefs, Seahawks parlay, $5-&gt;$30.69…</p>
<p>These three games are getting dangerously close to the 100%-zone, so may be considered.</p>

<p>The plays it suggests here are Carolina (-11.5), Kansas City (-5.5) and Cincinnati (-3). I like these as well, but hate huge lines like the Carolina game. We will see. Parlays are a bigger gamble, but more fun.</p>
