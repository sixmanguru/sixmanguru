<p>We’ve all played that game I beat so-and-so, who beat so-and-so, so by the transitive property, I also beat that player.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote about the path from Australian Chris Fletcher’s indirect win over the world’s top-ranked player, Novak Djokovic. I was knee-deep into the research on that when I discovered it counted walkovers.</p>
<p>I rewrote a little code and today I top that. No walkovers, longer paths.</p>
<p>Our journey this time starts in Uzbekistan where 18 year old Saida’lo Saidkarimov defeats Sarvar Ikramov in the second round of the Tashkent Challenger. Saidkarimov is a wild card and only garners one main draw victory this year (at Uzbekistan F4) and sits appropriately ranked 2150.</p>
<p>Ikramov is a former top-600 player. In 2012, he reached a high of 535. In 2015 at the Samarkand Challenger, he defeated another fellow Uzbek, Anton Djamalov, 61 62 in the first round of qualifying.</p>
<p>Djamalov is currently unranked and has only ever reached a career high of 1849, back in 2014. He has 60 60 losses in two recent Futures this Fall to such luminaries as Pavel Tsoy and Peter Bothwell. But at the Fergana Challenger he got a first round qualifying win over another Uzbek, Azizbek Lukmanov, 64 64.</p>
<p>Lukmanov is another guy who has fared poorly on the pro circuit (he has a single Futures main draw win this year), but can get direct entry into just about any Uzbek challenger. At Karshi, he defeated Timur Khabibulin, 64 36 63 in first round qualifying.</p>
<p>Khabibulin is a top-900 player from Kazakhstan, who has at least won a handful of matches. Heck, he’s even reached the final of a pair of double Futures this season. At the Astana Challenger in August, he defeated Djurabeck Karimov, 62 64.</p>
<p>Karimov, whose first name is recognized as <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/djurabeck-karimov/kg72/overview" target="_blank">Djurabeck by the ATP</a>, but <a href="http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=100210597" target="_blank">Jurabek in the ITF database</a>, is a 17-year old Uzbek, who has risen into the top-800 this year. Karimov beat Divij Sharan of India, 46 64 76, at the Samarkand Challenger.</p>
<p>Sharan, a former top-500 player is now more of a doubles specialist with over 20 titles to his name and also reached the round of 16 at the US Open in 2013. At that same popular Samarkand Challenger, Sharan defeated Denis Matsukevitch, 61 36 62, in third round qualifying.</p>

<p>Matsukevitch is another of those players who is recognized by the ATP and <a href="http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=100002303" target="_blank">ITF</a> by different names. <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/denis-matsukevich/mc18/overview" target="_blank">The ATP spells his last name without the ‘t’.</a> The Russian is also a former top-300 player, but at the Cherbourgh Challenger he defeated Frederik Nielsen, 76 62.</p>
<p>Here’s where we get into familiar territory. Nielsen, the 2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion took down Ryan Harrison at the Manchester Challenger, 61 57 62. Then Harrison tops Dr. Ivo in Acapulco, 46 76 76. This brings us all the way home to the Karlovic win over Djokovic in Doha early in the season.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Eleven matches to get from an 18-year old Uzbek player with one ATP point all the way to the best player in the world without a single walkover.</p>
<p>This research has also prompted me to think of a deep dive into the apparent weakness of the Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan Challengers. I’ve known for awhile they were weak, but just how weak may be a topic for the future.</p>
<p><strong>THE PATH FROM SAIDKARIMOV TO DJOKOVIC</strong><br/>
Saida’lo Saidkarimov (UZB) d. Sarvar Ikramov (UZB) — Tashkent Challenger<br/>
Sarvar Ikramov (UZB) d. Anton Djamalov (UZB) — Samarkand Challenger<br/>
Anton Djamalov (UZB) d. Azizbek Lukmanov (UZB) — Fergana Challenger<br/>
Azizbek Lukmanov (UZB) d. Timur Khabibulin (KAZ) — Karshi Challenger<br/>
Timur Khabibulin (KAZ) d. Djurabeck Karimov (UZB) — Astana Challenger<br/>
Djurabeck Karimov (UZB) d. Divij Sharan (IND) — Samarkand Challenger<br/>
Divij Sharan (IND) d. Denis Matsukevitch (RUS) — Samarkand Challenger<br/>
Denis Matsukevitch (RUS) d. Frederik Nielsen (DEN) — Cherbourgh Challenger<br/>
Frederik Nielsen (DEN) d. Ryan Harrison (USA) — Manchester Challenger<br/>
Ryan Harrison (USA) d. Ivo Karlovic (CRO) — Acapulco<br/>
Ivo Karlovic (CRO) d. Novak Djokovic – Doha</p>
<p><strong>Ed Note:</strong> there is a slight possibility that this can be accomplished in a shorter path from Saidkarimov to Djokovic with the imperfect issue of ATP vs. ITF naming recognition.</p>
