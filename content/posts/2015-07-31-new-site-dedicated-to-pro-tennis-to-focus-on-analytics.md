<p>Over the past few weeks I have been working on a new website, www.thestringtheory.net, dedicated to professional tennis analytics.</p>
<p>The site will primarily focus on the lower ITF Circuits to begin with. I have started collecting data and posted a brief article highlighting the first half of the 2015 season.</p>

<p>The website also boasts a Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/th3str1ngth30ry" target="_blank">@th3str1ngth30ry</a>, which for the time being mostly tweets from a bot I built. The bot ‘visits’ the ITF live scoreboard every 24 minutes, sees if any matches are done and tweets out any results. It was quite a cool little project since they try to hide their data inside Flash, but with a little help, I managed to get it figured out. The program is not 100% stable, as the Java-based driver it uses seems to have some issues every once in awhile.</p>
<p>I hope to write more about the site, the bot and the analytics soon.</p>
