<p>I am a self-described nerd, who is currently a 48-year old graduate student in the Business Analytics program at the McCombs Business School at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>In 1993, I developed a rankings system for six-man football in Texas. I ran a newsletter called The Huntress Report, which later became the website, <a href="http://sixmanfootball.com/">sixmanfootball.com</a>.</p>

<p>About five years ago I began a website dedicated to college tennis in Texas, <a href="http://texascollegetennis.com/">texascollegetennis.com</a>. I repost press releases and used to blog until I became an employee within the UT Athletics Department. I hope to get back to blogging there soon, but will definitely keep posting the team rankings I develop several years ago.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to centralize my blogging and have a place where I can post  other projects that do not generally fall into these two categories of my life.</p>
<p>I have an awesome life which includes my wife Tara and our two kids, Kepler and Colby.</p>
